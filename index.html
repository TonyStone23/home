		<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I am currently junior undergraduate attending <a href="https://www.southernct.edu/">Southern Connecticut State University</a> where I am pursuing a B.S. in computer science with a minor in mathematics.</p>

			<h2>Academic Pursuits</h2>
			
				<p>I have been extremely fortunate as to have engaged in various research activities while attending SCSU, working closely with faculty in the Computer Science and Mathematics departments.</p>
				<h3>Research Interests</h3>

				<ul>
					<li><b>Theoretical Computer Science</b>
					<br />--- I am interested in exploring approximation algorithms, and combinatorial optimization, graph theory, and time complexity. I am particularly interested in their application to graph theory problems, logic problems, and logic puzzles!
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>Research Experience</h3>
					<ul>
					<li><b>Honors Thesis</b><br />--- Honors thesis, Fall 2026 - Spring 2027 Session
						<p>I plan to pursue an Honors Thesis during my senior year... I plan to do a project that involves representing logic puzzles (stained-glass, sudoku, numeberlink) as graphs, and applying algorithms. Stay tuned!</p>
					</li>
					<li><b>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for Concrete Bridge Inspection</b><br />--- Independent Study, Fall 2025</li>
						<p>I worked with <a href="https://southernct.elsevierpure.com/en/persons/alaa-sheta/">Alaa Sheta</a> to investigate the use of UAVs and Convolutional Neural Networks to detect cracking in concrede bridge infrastructure. This has exposed me to various computer vision methodology, and robotics systems/control. I was able to present this work to the Computer Science Club at SCSU. For more, see <a href="https://github.com/TonyStone23/UAV-for-Concrete-Crack-Inspection">here.</a></p>
						
						
					<li><b>Metaheuristic Search Algorithms for Neural Network Training</b><br />--- Research Assistantship, Summer 2025</li>
						<p>I also worked with <a href="https://southernct.elsevierpure.com/en/persons/alaa-sheta/">Alaa Sheta</a> over the summer to explore the use of MHs to train ANNs, improving performance as opposed to traditional training approaches. This project was largely data driven, where I learned about how to utilize and manage data, various ANN training techniques, statistical evaluations of ANN performance, and MHs. For more, see <a href="https://github.com/TonyStone23/Summer-Research-2025">here.</a></p>
					
					<li><b>Discretization and Computing of Dynamical Systems</b><br />--- Independent Study, Spring 2025</li>
						<p>I worked with <a href="https://danielmichaelcicala.github.io/">Daniel Cicala</a> to learn about computing dynamical systems. We explored different approximation techniques, and implemented them to compute various dynamical systems, such as the Lotka-Volterra Model, SIR/SIRV Model, and the Lornenze Attractor. I was able to present my portion of the work to the Math Seminar at SCSU! For more, see <a href="https://github.com/TonyStone23/Dynamical-Systems-Simulation">here</a>.</p>
					</ul>
					
				<h3>Education and Tutoring</h3>
					<ul>
					<li><b>Peer Academic Leader</b>
						<br />--- I currently work as a Peer Academic Leader (PAL) at the Center for Academic Success and Accessability Services (<a href="https://inside.southernct.edu/casas">CASAS</a>). This involves attending lecture and providing specific tutoring to courses. It is essentially SCSU's version of a teacher's assistant.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>In the Fall of 2025, I was a PAL for an <a href="https://github.com/TonyStone23/Introduction-to-Python">Introduction to Programming</a> course. 
								<li>In the Spring of 2026, I am a PAL for the <a href="https://github.com/TonyStone23/Data-Structures">Data Structures</a> course, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/TonyStone23/Computer-Systems">Computer Systems</a> course.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>I keep all of my lecture notes online for students (or anyone) to access!</p>
						</li>
					<li><b>Academic Tutor</b>
						<br />--- As of the Fall 2024 session, I have also worked as a Tutor, engaged in one-on-one tutoring sessions for various CS and Math courses, all the way from algebra basics, to discrete math, to algorithm analysis!</li>
					</ul>
		<hr />
			<h2>Other Interests</h2>
				<p>Alongside my interest in computer science, I also enjoy:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Logic/word Puzzles</b>,<br />--- Sudokus, Rubik's Cubes, crosswords.</li> 
					<li><b>Weightlifting</b><br />--- Mostly strength-training.</li>
					<li><b>Reading</b><br />--- Classic novels, classic poetry.</li>
					<li><b>Music</b><br />--- 70-80's rock, electric guitar.</li>
				
				</ul>
